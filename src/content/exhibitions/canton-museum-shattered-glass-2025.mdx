## Exhibition Overview

"Shattered Glass: The Women Who Elevated American Art" celebrates pioneering women artists who transformed American art history. The Canton Museum of Art presents this significant exhibition featuring two of Dr. Masumi Hayashi's powerful works documenting Japanese American internment camps.

Hayashi's inclusion honors her groundbreaking work documenting the Japanese American internment experience through innovative panoramic photo-collage, creating immersive visual records of these historic sites that continue to resonate with contemporary audiences.

## Featured Works

The exhibition features two major works from Dr. Hayashi's acclaimed Internment Camps series:

### Heart Mountain Relocation Camp, Interior
From the American Concentration Camps series (1990-1995)

This powerful work documents the interior spaces of Heart Mountain Relocation Camp in Wyoming, one of the ten concentration camps where Japanese Americans were forcibly incarcerated during World War II. Hayashi's panoramic technique creates an immersive perspective that allows viewers to experience these historic spaces in their full architectural and emotional context.

### Manzanar Relocation Camp, Tree View, Inyo, California
Panoramic photo-collage with Fuji Crystal Archive prints, 1995
Size: 27" x 63"

This iconic image presents the stark landscape of Manzanar Relocation Camp in California's Owens Valley, set against the dramatic backdrop of the Sierra Nevada mountains. The lone tree standing among the foundations creates a poignant memorial to the 10,000 Japanese Americans imprisoned at this site.

## Collection Loan

Both works are generously loaned from the **Akron Art Museum's permanent collection**, demonstrating the ongoing circulation and importance of Hayashi's work within Ohio's cultural institutions.

## Exhibition Significance

### Breaking Barriers

"Shattered Glass" refers to breaking the "glass ceiling," the invisible barriers that prevent qualified people from advancing in their careers. This is the **first original exhibition at the Canton Museum of Art to highlight only female artists** and their heavily ignored contributions to American art.

The exhibition features approximately 100 works in various mediums - from oil paintings to ceramics and film - by artists including Georgia O'Keeffe, Mary Cassatt, Dorothea Lange, Lee Krasner, Judy Chicago, and many others who revolutionized their fields while facing adversity due to gender, race, sexuality, and economic status.

### Dr. Hayashi's Contribution

Dr. Hayashi's inclusion recognizes her unique contribution to:

- Documentary photography and social justice art
- Asian American artistic expression
- Environmental and industrial documentation
- Innovative photographic techniques

### The Internment Camps Series

Hayashi's documentation of Japanese American internment camps represents a crucial body of work that:

- Preserves visual memory of this dark chapter in American history
- Offers unprecedented panoramic perspectives on these historic sites
- Combines artistic innovation with historical documentation
- Continues to educate new generations about wartime injustice

Her personal connection to this history - her mother was interned during World War II - infuses the work with both artistic rigor and deep emotional resonance.
