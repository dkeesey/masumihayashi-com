## Cost Comparison

### Your Current Setup: R2

**Storage**: 383MB
```
Storage: 383MB × $0.015/GB = $0.006/month
Bandwidth: Unlimited = $0/month
Operations: 804 uploads (one-time) = $0.004
───────────────────────────────────────
Total: $0.01/month ($0.12/year)
```

### Alternative: Cloudflare Images

**Pricing**:
```
Base Plan: $5/month (includes 100k images served)

Storage: $5/month per 100k images stored

Your Site:
- Stored images: 804 images
- Images served: ~50k/month (estimate)
───────────────────────────────────────
Storage: 804 images = $5/month (minimum)
Serving: 50k images = $5 base
───────────────────────────────────────
Total: $5-10/month ($60-120/year)
```

✅ Budget-conscious (free tier sufficient)

✅ Simple workflow (upload and serve)
✅ Full control over image processing

**Your Use Case**: ✅ **PERFECT FOR R2**

### Use Cloudflare Images When:

- Willing to pay $5-10/month

**Examples**:

- Content management systems
- User-generated content platforms

---

## Your Current Workflow (R2)

**Image Processing Pipeline**:
```
1. Python Script (local)
   ├── Read original high-res images
   ├── Generate 6 breakpoints (640w, 768w, 1024w, 1440w, 1920w, 2460w)
   ├── Optimize quality
   ├── Add watermarks/captions
   └── Save to public/images/responsive/

2. Upload to R2
   └── wrangler r2 object put (one-time)

3. Serve via CDN
   └── https://images.masumihayashi.com/artworks/image-1440w.jpg
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Full control over processing
- ✅ High-quality output
- ✅ Watermarks/captions baked in
- ✅ Near-zero cost
- ✅ Fast (pre-processed, no runtime cost)

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Must pre-process images (extra step)
- ❌ Can't dynamically resize
- ❌ Manual format conversion
- ❌ Larger storage (6 versions per image)

---

## If You Used Cloudflare Images

**Alternative Workflow**:
```
1. Upload Original (one file per image)
   └── cloudflare images upload original.jpg

2. Serve with Transformations
   ├── <img src="image/w=640">   (mobile)
   ├── <img src="image/w=1440">  (desktop)
   └── <img src="image/format=webp"> (WebP browsers)
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ One file per image (smaller storage)
- ✅ Automatic format conversion
- ✅ On-the-fly resizing
- ✅ Automatic optimization

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ $60-120/year cost
- ❌ Less control over output
- ❌ Can't bake in watermarks easily
- ❌ Runtime processing (slightly slower first load)

---

## Hybrid Approach (Future Option)

You could combine both:

**R2 for Static Images**:
- Pre-processed artwork images (current setup)
- Museum-quality output with watermarks
- Near-zero cost

**Cloudflare Images for Dynamic**:
- User-uploaded exhibition photos
- News/blog post images
- Admin-uploaded content

**Cost**: $5/month + $0.01/month = $5.01/month

---

## Your Decision: Was it Right?

### ✅ YES - R2 is Perfect For You

**Reasons**:

1. **Static Content**
   - Artwork doesn't change
   - Pre-processing is fine
   - No user uploads

2. **Budget**
   - $0.12/year vs $60-120/year
   - 99.8% cost savings

3. **Quality Control**
   - You control image processing
   - Can add watermarks/captions
   - Museum-quality output

4. **Performance**
   - Pre-processed = faster loads
   - No runtime transformation delay
   - Optimized for your exact breakpoints

5. **Scale**
   - 804 images = no problem
   - Add 1000 more = still ~$0.02/month

### ❌ Cloudflare Images Would Be OVERKILL

**You don't need**:
- On-the-fly resizing (you pre-process)
- Dynamic transformations (static content)
- Automatic format detection (you control formats)
- $60-120/year cost (budget matters)
