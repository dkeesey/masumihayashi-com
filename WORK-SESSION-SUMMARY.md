# Work Session Summary - 2025-10-21

**Session Duration**: User AFK - Autonomous work mode
**Focus**: Navigation buildout, schema implementation, content migration discovery

---

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Chevron in Artwork Mega Menu
**File**: `src/components/ui/NavMenu.tsx`

**Problem**: NavigationMenuTrigger component already includes a chevron icon, but NavMenu.tsx manually added another one

**Solution**: Removed manually-added ChevronDown from NavigationMenuTrigger (kept in mobile accordion where it's still needed)

**Result**: Clean single chevron on Artwork dropdown

---

### 2. Added CreativeWorkSeries Schema
**File**: `src/lib/schema.ts`

**Implementation**:
```typescript
export interface SeriesData {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  url: string;
  artworkCount: number;
  dateCreated: string;
  genre: string[];
}

export function generateSeriesSchema(series: SeriesData): WithContext<Thing> {
  return {
    "@context": "https://schema.org",
    "@type": "CreativeWorkSeries",
    "@id": `${SITE_URL}${series.url}#series`,
    "name": series.name,
    "description": series.description,
    "url": `${SITE_URL}${series.url}`,
    "creator": { "@id": `${SITE_URL}/#masumi` },
    "dateCreated": series.dateCreated,
    "genre": series.genre,
    "numberOfItems": series.artworkCount,
    "inLanguage": "en-US"
  };
}
```

**Status**: Ready for use on all 8 series landing pages

---

### 3. Created RelatedArtworks Component
**File**: `src/components/RelatedArtworks.astro`

**Features**:
- Grid display of 3-6 related artworks from same series
- Cloudinary image integration
- Hover effects with scale transform
- "View All" link to series page
- Responsive grid (1/2/3 columns)
- SEO-friendly internal linking

**Usage Example**:
```astro
<RelatedArtworks
  artworks={relatedWorks}
  seriesName="Japanese American Internment Camps"
  seriesPath="/artwork/japanese-american-internment-camps"
  maxItems={6}
/>
```

**Status**: Component created, ready for integration into artwork pages

---

### 4. Integrated Breadcrumbs into BaseLayout
**Files**:
- `src/components/Breadcrumbs.astro` (component)
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` (integration)

**Implementation**:
- Schema.org BreadcrumbList markup
- WCAG-compliant accessible navigation
- Auto-renders when breadcrumbs prop provided
- Styled with primary interactive colors

**Usage**:
```astro
<BaseLayout
  title="Artwork Title"
  breadcrumbs={[
    { label: "Home", href: "/" },
    { label: "Artwork", href: "/artwork/" },
    { label: "Internment Camps", href: "/artwork/japanese-american-internment-camps/" },
    { label: "Manzanar Monument", href: "" }
  ]}
>
```

**Status**: Integrated into BaseLayout, needs manual breadcrumb data per page (or auto-generation from URL)

---

### 5. Architectural Analysis Completed
**File**: `ARCHITECTURE-ANALYSIS.md`

**Key Findings**:

**Strengths**:
- Modern tech stack (Astro 5.14+, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Strong component architecture
- Schema.org implementation ready for AI SEO
- Navigation system (mega menu + footer inventory)

**Weaknesses**:
- Content availability gap (7 of 8 series missing data)
- Manual schema integration (should be in layouts)
- Multiple layout types without clear guidelines
- Content collection schema duplication

**Critical Blocker Identified**: Need artwork data migration strategy

---

### 6. Content Migration Path Discovered ✅ **BREAKTHROUGH**

**Data Source Found**: `/Users/deankeesey/Workspace/dk-sites/docs/masumi/canonical-content/artworks/`

**Directory Structure**:
```
canonical-content/artworks/
├── abandoned-prisons/          (31 artworks)
├── city-works/                 (35 artworks)
├── commissions/                (19 artworks)
├── epa-superfund-sites/        (28 artworks)
├── ja-internment-camps/        (51 artworks)  ← Already migrated
├── post-industrial-landscapes/ (64 artworks)
├── sacred-architectures/       (127 artworks)
└── war-and-military-sites/     (9 artworks)

Total: ~350+ artworks extracted from master CSV
```

**Extraction Script**: `/Users/deankeesey/Workspace/dk-sites/docs/masumi/extract-tier1-artworks.py`

**Canonical Format** (YAML frontmatter):
```yaml
---
pieceId: 09001
series: "Sacred Architectures"
seriesCode: "09"
title: "Airavatesvara Temple #1"
slug: "airavatesvara-temple-1-darasuram-tamil-nadu-india"
date: 2004
city: "Darasuram"
state: "Tamil Nadu"
country: "India"
medium: "Panoramic Photo Collage"
dimensions: "53x24"
referenceImageUrl: ""
hasReferenceImage: true
tier: 1
---
# [Rich markdown content with historical/cultural context]
```

**Target Format** (masumihayashi-com MDX):
```yaml
---
content-type: artwork
series: Sacred Architectures
slug: airavatesvara-temple-1-darasuram-tamil-nadu-india
name: Airavatesvara Temple #1
title: Airavatesvara Temple #1, Darasuram, Tamil Nadu, India
altTag: Picture of Airavatesvara Temple #1 by Dr. Masumi Hayashi
media: Panoramic photo collage
year: 2004
city: Darasuram
state: Tamil Nadu
country: India
size: 53" x 24"
cloudinaryId: /sacred-architectures/airavatesvara-temple-1_abc123
---
```

**Key Differences**:
1. Field name mapping (e.g., `date` → `year`, `medium` → `media`)
2. Size format (`53x24` → `53" x 24"`)
3. Need to generate Cloudinary IDs (currently missing in canonical)
4. MDX format instead of pure Markdown
5. Simpler frontmatter (canonical has extensive inventory tracking)

---

## Pending Tasks (Ready to Execute)

### Priority 1: Content Migration Script

**Task**: Create transformation script to convert canonical markdown → Astro MDX

**Script Requirements**:
1. Read from `/Users/deankeesey/Workspace/dk-sites/docs/masumi/canonical-content/artworks/[series]/`
2. Transform frontmatter fields:
   - `date` → `year`
   - `medium` → `media`
   - `dimensions` → `size` (add inch marks)
   - `series` → map to display names
3. Generate or map Cloudinary IDs
4. Write to `/Users/deankeesey/Workspace/dk-sites/masumihayashi-com/src/content/artwork/[series]/`
5. Validate against content schema

**Series Mapping**:
```
abandoned-prisons       → prisons/
city-works              → city-works/
commissions             → commissions/
epa-superfund-sites     → epa-superfund/
ja-internment-camps     → japanese-american-internment-camps/  ✅ EXISTS
post-industrial-landscapes → post-industrial/
sacred-architectures    → sacred-architectures/
war-and-military-sites  → war-military/
```

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours to write + test script

---

### Priority 2: Generate Cloudinary IDs

**Problem**: Canonical content has `referenceImageUrl: ""` (empty)

**Options**:
1. **Check Cloudinary directly** - Do images already exist in folders?
2. **Use piece ID as Cloudinary ID** - `/sacred-architectures/09001`
3. **Use slug as Cloudinary ID** - `/sacred-architectures/airavatesvara-temple-1`
4. **Ask user** - What's the Cloudinary naming convention?

**Recommendation**: Check Cloudinary for existing folder structure, then decide mapping strategy

---

### Priority 3: Create Gallery Pages (Templates)

**Task**: Create 7 new series gallery pages using japanese-american-internment-camps/index.astro as template

**Pages to Create**:
1. `/artwork/sacred-architectures/index.astro`
2. `/artwork/post-industrial/index.astro`
3. `/artwork/prisons/index.astro`
4. `/artwork/war-military/index.astro`
5. `/artwork/epa-superfund/index.astro`
6. `/artwork/city-works/index.astro`
7. `/artwork/commissions/index.astro`

**Template Pattern**:
```typescript
// 1. Import GalleryScrollLayout
// 2. Get collection: await getCollection("artwork")
// 3. Filter by series: filter(entry => entry.data.series === "Series Name")
// 4. Generate SEO tags with series info
// 5. Render title section + artwork grid
// 6. Add CreativeWorkSeries schema
```

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 hours (mostly copy/paste/adapt)

---

### Priority 4: Add Schema to Layouts (Systematic Integration)

**Current State**: Schema manually added to individual pages

**Target State**: Layouts automatically inject appropriate schema

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// BaseLayout.astro should auto-add:
- Organization schema (site-wide)
- Breadcrumb schema (from breadcrumbs prop)

// GalleryScrollLayout.astro should auto-add:
- Person schema (Masumi)
- CreativeWorkSeries schema (from series prop)

// Individual artwork pages should auto-add:
- VisualArtwork schema (from frontmatter)
- ImageObject schema (from Cloudinary ID)
```

**Estimated Effort**: 2 hours

---

## Questions for User (When You Return)

### 1. Cloudinary ID Strategy
**Question**: How should we map artwork files to Cloudinary IDs?

**Options**:
a) Use piece ID: `/sacred-architectures/09001`
b) Use slug: `/sacred-architectures/airavatesvara-temple-1`
c) Check what already exists in Cloudinary and match
d) Other naming convention?

**Current State**: Canonical content has empty `referenceImageUrl` fields

---

### 2. Content Migration Approach
**Question**: Should we migrate all 350+ artworks now, or start with a subset?

**Recommendation**: Start with 1-2 series to validate the migration script, then scale to all series

**Suggested Pilot**:
- Sacred Architectures (127 artworks) - largest series, good test
- War & Military Sites (9 artworks) - smallest, quick validation

---

### 3. Rich Content Preservation
**Question**: The canonical markdown files have extensive historical/cultural context (see example above - detailed temple history, architectural analysis, etc.). Should we preserve this content?

**Options**:
a) Keep full content in MDX body
b) Extract to separate "about" or "context" field
c) Discard for now (focus on metadata only)

**Current internment-camps approach**: Minimal content, imports data component

---

### 4. Layout Usage Guidelines
**Question**: Should we consolidate or document the 5 different layout types?

**Current Layouts**:
- BaseLayout - Standard pages
- HeroLayout - Pages with hero images
- GalleryScrollLayout - Full-screen galleries (used for series)
- LongFormLayout - Essays with TOC
- ScrollSnapLayout - Snap-scrolling

**Recommendation**: Document when to use each, or consolidate similar ones

---

---

## Architecture Insights

### What Works Well
1. **Component modularity** - Easy to add new components (Breadcrumbs, RelatedArtworks)
2. **Schema system** - Well-structured schema generation functions
3. **Navigation patterns** - Mega menu + footer provides good UX
4. **Type safety** - TypeScript catching issues early

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Content availability** - Blocker resolved (found canonical source!)
2. **Schema integration** - Should be automatic in layouts
3. **Data transformation** - Need migration script to bridge formats
4. **Cloudinary mapping** - Need consistent ID strategy

### Risks
1. **Cloudinary IDs missing** - May need manual mapping or Cloudinary audit
2. **Content richness** - Canonical has detailed content, current site has minimal content
3. **Scale** - 350+ artworks is a lot to migrate/validate
4. **URL consistency** - Need 301 redirects from old WordPress URLs?
