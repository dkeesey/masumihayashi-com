# Gallery UX Fixes - October 22, 2025

## âœ… All Issues Fixed & Deployed

---

## 1. Enhanced Scroll Peek Effect

### Before:
- Next image barely visible at bottom (30vh height, 30% opacity)
- Users didn't realize there was more content below

### After:
- Next image now 50vh tall (half viewport height)
- Positioned at `-25vh` (extends above and below viewport edge)
- Increased opacity to 60%
- Creates enticing "half-rendered" effect that invites scrolling

**Files affected**: All 8 gallery pages

---

## 2. Fixed Cursor Metaphor

### Before:
- `cursor: zoom-in` on artwork links
- Incorrect expectation: clicking would zoom image

### After:
- `cursor: pointer` (standard link cursor)
- Correct metaphor: clicking navigates to detail page

**Files affected**: All 8 gallery pages

---

## 3. Changed Icon from Magnifying Glass to Arrow

### Before:
- Magnifying glass with + sign (zoom metaphor)
- Misleading - actual behavior is navigation, not zoom

### After:
- Right arrow icon (â†’)
- Correct metaphor: "view details" / "go to page"

**SVG changed**:
```html
<!-- Before: Magnifying glass -->
<circle cx="11" cy="11" r="8"></circle>
<line x1="21" y1="21" x2="16.65" y2="16.65"></line>
<line x1="11" y1="8" x2="11" y2="14"></line>
<line x1="8" y1="11" x2="14" y2="11"></line>

<!-- After: Right arrow -->
<path d="M5 12h14"></path>
<path d="m12 5 7 7-7 7"></path>
```

**Files affected**: All 8 gallery pages

---

## 4. Added Keyboard Navigation Hints

### Before:
- "Scroll to view artwork"
- No mention of keyboard alternatives

### After:
- "Scroll, use Tab, or Space to view artwork"
- Educates users about keyboard navigation options

**Files affected**: All 8 gallery pages

---

## 5. Fixed Broken RelatedArtworks Component

### The Problem:
You said: _"At the bottom is a broken component that is supposed to show the other works masumi created at that internment camp site. But that component is broken."_

**Root cause**: Component existed (`src/components/RelatedArtworks.astro`) but was NOT being used on artwork detail pages!

### Before:
```astro
<!-- Ugly footer with verbose list -->
<footer>
  <h2>Japanese-American Internment Camps</h2>
  <ul>
    {allArtworks.map(art => <li>{art.title}</li>)}
  </ul>
</footer>
```

### After:
```astro
<!-- Beautiful related artworks grid -->
import RelatedArtworks from "../../../components/RelatedArtworks.astro";

const relatedWorks = allArtworks
  .filter(art =>
    art.data.series === entry.data.series &&
    art.slug !== entry.slug
  )
  .slice(0, 6);

<RelatedArtworks
  artworks={relatedWorks}
  seriesName={entry.data.series}
  seriesPath="/artwork/japanese-american-internment-camps"
  maxItems={6}
/>
```

**Features now working**:
- Shows 6 related artworks from same series
- Excludes current artwork
- Grid layout (1/2/3 columns responsive)
- Hover effects with image zoom
- "View All Artworks in [Series]" link at bottom

**Files affected**: `src/pages/artwork/japanese-american-internment-camps/[slug].astro`

## Scroll Snap Behavior

**Current status**: Already working correctly
- `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory` on gallery container
- `scroll-snap-align: start` on each section
- No changes needed - working as designed

---

## Technical Implementation

### Gallery Page Changes (8 files):
```
src/pages/artwork/
â”œâ”€â”€ japanese-american-internment-camps/index.astro âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ sacred-architectures/index.astro              âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ post-industrial/index.astro                   âœ…

## Git Commit

**SHA**: `42183ee`
**Message**: "Fix gallery UX issues and RelatedArtworks component"
**Files Changed**: 9 (8 galleries + 1 detail page)

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

### For Other Series Detail Pages:
Currently only internment-camps has individual artwork detail pages (`[slug].astro`). If you want detail pages for the other 7 series, we'd need to create:

```
src/pages/artwork/
â”œâ”€â”€ sacred-architectures/[slug].astro
â”œâ”€â”€ post-industrial/[slug].astro
â”œâ”€â”€ prisons/[slug].astro
â”œâ”€â”€ war-military/[slug].astro
â”œâ”€â”€ epa-superfund/[slug].astro
â”œâ”€â”€ city-works/[slug].astro
â””â”€â”€ commissions/[slug].astro
```

Each would use the same RelatedArtworks pattern we just implemented.

**Estimate**: 30-60 minutes to create all 7 templates
