## 4. Map Page

#### Status: ‚úÖ Identical

- Map visualization matches
- Layout matches
- No visual differences detected

---

## IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: Staging vs Local Mismatch

**Critical Finding**: The staging site (masumihayashi-com.pages.dev) is NOT showing photographer camera icons, but the local dev site (localhost:4321) IS showing them correctly!

**Evidence**:
- Local screenshot (`akiya-local-fresh.png`): Shows 8 red camera icons above photographer names ‚úÖ
- Staging screenshot (`staging-akiya-NOW.png`): Shows only text links, NO camera icons ‚ùå
- HTML inspection: `<img src="/_astro/butcam.DttgQj4w_Z16pLzl.webp">` tags ARE present in staging HTML
- Image file check: `curl -I` confirms the WebP file EXISTS on staging (HTTP 200)
- Image validation: Downloaded staging image is valid 48x48 WebP

**Diagnosis**: This is a deployment/build issue, NOT a code issue. The images are:
1. In the source code ‚úÖ
2. In the HTML markup ‚úÖ
3. On the server ‚úÖ
4. But NOT rendering in the browser ‚ùå

**Next Steps**: Need to investigate Cloudflare Pages build logs or force a fresh deployment.

## Final Summary for User Review

### What I Found ‚úÖ

**Pages Reviewed**: 11 sample pages from all major categories

- Historical Documents, Map, Bibliography: ‚úÖ Identical
- Artist Statement: ‚úÖ Fixed (paragraph spacing)
- Family Album pages: ‚úÖ Dark theme working, ‚ö†Ô∏è but icons not rendering on staging

### Critical Issues Requiring Action üö®

1. **Photographer Camera Icons (Staging Only)**
   - Works perfectly on local dev
   - Not rendering on masumihayashi-com.pages.dev
   - All code is correct, images exist on server
   - **User Action Needed**: This may require Cloudflare Pages troubleshooting or cache clearing

2. **Typography Hierarchy**
   - Section headings (h2, h3) appear lighter/smaller on staging vs original
   - Affects camps overview, bibliography, and other long-form content pages
   - **Recommendation**: Review and potentially increase font-weight for headings

3. **Research Section Font (Artwork Detail Pages)**
   - Original uses monospace/typewriter font for research text
   - Staging uses regular sans-serif
   - **Question for User**: Is monospace font intentional for archival feel?

### Design Decisions to Confirm

1. **Accent Colors**: All dates and collection names use gold/yellow (#ffd700) - matches original
2. **Dark Theme**: Family Album pages use pure black background - matches original
3. **Paragraph Spacing**: 1.25em spacing applied - matches original
4. **Footer Design**: Structure appears identical

### Pages Not Yet Reviewed (42 remaining)

- 26 individual artwork detail pages
- 6 additional family album photographer pages

### Recommended Next Steps

**Option A - Fix Typography & Continue Review**:
1. Adjust heading weights in global.css
2. Review remaining 42 pages systematically
3. Document any additional styling differences
4. Investigate Cloudflare deployment for icon issue

**Option B - Flag for User Review First**:
1. Present current findings to user
2. Get confirmation on design decisions (monospace fonts, etc.)
3. Get user input on photographer icon staging issue
4. Proceed based on user priorities

**My Recommendation**: Option B - Get user feedback now before continuing, especially on the photographer icon issue and typography decisions.
