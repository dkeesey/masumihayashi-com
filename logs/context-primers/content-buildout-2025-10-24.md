### Breakpoint Specifications

| Breakpoint | Width | Font Size | Avg Size | Layout | Use Case |
|------------|-------|-----------|----------|--------|----------|
| mobile | 640px | 18pt | ~80KB | 3-line centered | Phones portrait |
| tablet | 768px | 18pt | ~120KB | 3-line centered | Tablets portrait |
| laptop | 1024px | 20pt | ~200KB | 2-column side-by-side | Small laptops |

### File Naming Convention

```
{artwork-slug}-{width}w.jpg

Examples:
old-arcade-640w.jpg
old-arcade-768w.jpg
old-arcade-1024w.jpg
old-arcade-1440w.jpg
old-arcade-1920w.jpg
old-arcade-2460w.jpg
```

### Automatic Quality Handling

The processing system automatically handled:
- **50 mobile font reductions** - Long titles scaled down to maintain readability
- **9 desktop title splits** - Natural line breaks at commas to prevent column overlap
- **3 desktop font reductions** - Very long titles with extensive media descriptions

All 174 artworks processed successfully, zero manual corrections needed.

## ResponsiveImage Component API

### Location
```
/src/components/ResponsiveImage.astro
```

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface Props {
  imageSlug: string;        // Artwork slug (e.g., "old-arcade")
  alt: string;              // Alt text for accessibility
  className?: string;       // Additional CSS classes
  loading?: 'lazy' | 'eager';  // Loading strategy (default: lazy)
}
```

### Usage Example
```astro
---
import ResponsiveImage from '@components/ResponsiveImage.astro';
---

<ResponsiveImage
  imageSlug="old-arcade"
  alt="Old Arcade, Cleveland, Ohio, 1996"
  loading="eager"
/>
```

### Generated HTML
```html
<img
  src="/images/responsive/old-arcade-1440w.jpg"
  srcset="/images/responsive/old-arcade-640w.jpg 640w,
          /images/responsive/old-arcade-768w.jpg 768w,
          /images/responsive/old-arcade-1024w.jpg 1024w,
          /images/responsive/old-arcade-1440w.jpg 1440w,
          /images/responsive/old-arcade-1920w.jpg 1920w,
          /images/responsive/old-arcade-2460w.jpg 2460w"
  sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 90vw"
  alt="Old Arcade, Cleveland, Ohio, 1996"
  loading="eager"
  class="max-w-full max-h-full w-auto h-auto object-contain"
/>
```

### Current Styling
```css
max-w-full max-h-full w-auto h-auto object-contain
```

**Note**: User mentioned viewport bounding may be missing. Check if additional container constraints needed.

## Known Issues / Questions

### User-Reported Issue (2025-10-24)
**URL**: http://localhost:4321/artwork/city-works/
**Issue**: "I thought we had code in the component that keeps the vertical and horizontal dimension bounded by the viewport?"

**Current styling** (line 56 of ResponsiveImage.astro):
```html
class="max-w-full max-h-full w-auto h-auto object-contain"
```

**Potential missing constraints:**
- No explicit viewport height constraint (max-h-screen?)
- Parent container may need constraints
- Layout may need flex/grid container with constraints

**Action needed**:
- Test actual behavior on artwork pages
- Compare with user expectations
- Add viewport bounding if missing
- May need wrapper div with max-h-screen
