- ❌ about.astro
- ❌ donate.astro
- ❌ interviews.astro
- ❌ family-album-project.astro

### Content: 0 of 4 collections (0% complete)

**Prototype has content in:**
- ❌ /content/artwork/ (multiple MDX files)
- ❌ /content/camps/ (camp data)
- ❌ /content/exhibitions/ (SFMOMA exhibition we just added)
- ❌ /content/family-album/ (family photos/stories)

**Production has:**
- ✅ config.ts (schema only, no actual content)

### Components: 20 of 70+ (29% complete)

**Migrated (infrastructure components):**
- ✅ 17 shadcn/ui components
- ✅ 3 Cloudinary components

**Missing (foundation-specific components):**
- ❌ CampGalleriesNav
- ❌ PhotographerCard/Grid/Layout
- ❌ ExhibitionInfo/Image
- ❌ FamilyAlbumIntro/Section
- ❌ InternmentCampLinks
- ❌ MonumentImage (multiple versions)
- ❌ TableOfContents
- ❌ Historical context components
- ❌ Audio player components
- ❌ ~40+ other specialized components

## Missing Assets

### Not Yet Configured:
- ❌ Cloudinary account credentials in .env
- ❌ Actual artwork images uploaded to Cloudinary
- ❌ Exhibition photos
- ❌ Family album photos
- ❌ Historical document scans
- ❌ Audio interview files

### Navigation/UX:
- ❌ Header component
- ❌ Footer component
- ❌ Navigation menu
- ❌ Mobile nav
- ❌ Breadcrumbs
- ❌ Persistent donate button

## What This Means

### Option A: Migrate Everything (Big Bang)
**Time:** 4-8 hours
**Strategy:** Copy all pages, content, and components from prototype
**Pros:** Everything works immediately
**Cons:** Brings over experimental code

### Option B: Rebuild Clean (Incremental)
**Time:** 2-4 weeks
**Strategy:** Rebuild each page deliberately, copying only what's needed
**Pros:** Clean, production-ready code
**Cons:** Slower to launch

### Option C: Hybrid (Recommended)
**Time:** 1-2 weeks
**Strategy:** Migrate core pages + content, rebuild specialty features
**Phase 1 (Week 1):** Core pages + navigation
- Home, About, Donate, SFMOMA exhibition
- Header/Footer
- Basic navigation
**Phase 2 (Week 2):** Content collections
- Artwork catalog
- Camp pages
- Family album
**Phase 3 (Week 3):** Advanced features
- PhotoSwipe galleries
- Audio interviews
- Historical documents

## Recommended Next Steps

**Immediate (Today):**
1. Decide on migration strategy (A/B/C)
2. If Option C: Migrate core 5 pages + navigation (2-3 hours)
3. Set up Cloudinary credentials
4. Deploy to staging URL for testing

**This Week:**
5. Migrate content collections (artwork, camps, exhibitions)
6. Upload core images to Cloudinary
7. Test on staging

**Next Week:**
8. Advanced features (galleries, audio)
9. Final content additions
10. Production launch

## Quick Decision Framework

**Choose Option A if:** You want to launch ASAP and clean up later
**Choose Option B if:** You have 4+ weeks and want perfect code
**Choose Option C if:** You want to launch in 1-2 weeks with quality

## What Would You Like to Do?

1. **Migrate everything now?** (I can do this in one session)
2. **Start with core 5 pages?** (Home, About, Donate, SFMOMA, Camps)
3. **Build incrementally from scratch?** (Clean room approach)

Ready to execute whichever you choose.
