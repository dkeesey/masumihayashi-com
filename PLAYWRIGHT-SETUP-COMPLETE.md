npm test
```

### Run with UI (Interactive Mode)
```bash
npm run test:ui
```

### Run in Headed Mode (See Browser)
```bash
npm run test:headed
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npx playwright test tests/smoke.spec.ts
```

### Run Specific Browser
```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium

```

## Test Execution Flow

1. **Playwright starts dev server** (`npm run dev`)
2. **Waits for server** (http://localhost:4321)
3. **Runs tests in parallel** across all browsers
4. **Captures failures** (screenshots + videos)
5. **Generates HTML report**
6. **Shuts down server** (or keeps running if already started)

## Verification

### Test List Verified
```bash
npx playwright test --list
# Output: Total: 110 tests in 2 files
```

### Breakdown
- 22 test specs
- 5 browser configurations
- 22 × 5 = 110 total test runs

## What's Next

### Immediate Testing (Ready Now)
```bash
# Start dev server (in one terminal)
npm run dev

# Run tests (in another terminal)
npm test
```

### Adding More Tests
1. Create new `.spec.ts` file in `tests/` directory

- [x] Video on retry enabled
- [x] Smoke test file created (10 tests)

## System Information

**Project**: masumihayashi-com
**Framework**: Astro 5.14.6
**Node Environment**: ES Modules (type: "module")
**Test Framework**: Playwright 1.56.1
**Browser Cache**: /Users/deankeesey/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/

## Next Steps

1. **Run initial test suite** to establish baseline
2. **Review test output** and adjust for current site state
3. **Add page-specific tests** as content is added
4. **Set up CI/CD integration** (GitHub Actions recommended)
5. **Monitor test health** in ongoing development

## Troubleshooting

### If tests fail initially
This is expected! The site currently has minimal content (just homepage). Tests are ready for when you add:
- About page
- Exhibition pages
- Artwork galleries
- Navigation menus

### Common issues
- **Port 4321 in use**: Kill existing process or change port
- **Tests timeout**: Increase timeout in config or check server
- **Flaky tests**: Add explicit waits or improve selectors

See **TESTING.md** for detailed troubleshooting guide.
