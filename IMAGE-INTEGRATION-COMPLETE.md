## Technical Implementation

### Component Created
- **File**: `src/components/ResponsiveImage.astro`
- **Features**:
  - 6 responsive breakpoints (640w, 768w, 1024w, 1440w, 1920w, 2460w)
  - Optimized srcset with proper descriptors
  - Smart sizes attribute for viewport-based selection
  - Lazy loading support
  - Async decoding for performance

### Galleries Updated
All 7 gallery index pages converted from `CloudinaryImage` to `ResponsiveImage`:
1. `src/pages/artwork/sacred-architectures/index.astro`
2. `src/pages/artwork/post-industrial/index.astro`
3. `src/pages/artwork/city-works/index.astro`
4. `src/pages/artwork/prisons/index.astro`
5. `src/pages/artwork/war-military/index.astro`
6. `src/pages/artwork/epa-superfund/index.astro`
7. `src/pages/artwork/commissions/index.astro`

### Image Processing Workflow

**Source**: `/Volumes/PRO-G40/MH-imageprocessing/responsive-variants/`
**Destination**: `public/images/responsive/`
**Script**: `scripts/smart-copy-images.js`

The script:
1. Reads all MDX files in `src/content/artwork/`
2. Extracts the `slug` field from frontmatter
3. Looks for matching images (with manual mappings for naming mismatches)
4. Copies and renames 6 breakpoint variants per artwork

### Manual Mappings

Created **140+ manual mappings** to bridge naming differences between:
- MDX slugs (SEO-friendly, location-included)
- Image processing slugs (shorter, location-excluded)

Examples:
```javascript
'angel-island-immigration-mens-section-san-francisco-california': 'angel-island-immigration-station'
'heart-mountain-internment-camp-blue-room': 'heart-mountain-blue-room'
'la-downtown-1987-los-angeles-california': 'los-angeles-downtown'
```

## Missing Artworks (4 total)

### Genuinely Missing from PRO-G40 Drive

1. **airavatesvara-temple-2-darasuram-tamil-nadu-india**
   - Gallery: Sacred Architectures
   - Note: Only `airavatesvara-temple-1` exists on drive
   - Action needed: Process temple-2 image or remove MDX

2. **la-subway-no-1-los-angeles-california**
   - Gallery: City Works
   - Note: `la-subway-no-2` exists, but not no-1
   - Action needed: Process or remove MDX

3. **asarco-smelter-tacoma-washington**
   - Gallery: EPA Superfund
   - Note: No matching image found on drive
   - Action needed: Check if original exists, process if so

4. **oserf-building-patio-columbus-ohio**
   - Gallery: Public Commissions
   - Note: Only `oserf-building-broad-street-view` exists
   - Action needed: Either find patio image or remove MDX

## Verification Process

Used Playwright to verify image loading across all galleries:

**Script**: `scripts/verify-gallery-images.js`

```bash
node scripts/verify-gallery-images.js
```

The script:
- Visits each gallery page
- Checks naturalWidth/naturalHeight of all images
- Reports broken images with their MDX slugs
- Saves detailed JSON report to `/tmp/gallery-image-verification.json`

## Files Modified

### Created
- `src/components/ResponsiveImage.astro` - New responsive image component
- `scripts/smart-copy-images.js` - Image copy/rename script
- `scripts/verify-gallery-images.js` - Playwright verification script
- `IMAGE-INTEGRATION-COMPLETE.md` - This file

### Modified
- `src/pages/artwork/*/index.astro` (7 files) - Updated to use ResponsiveImage

### Image Files
- Added: 576 JPG files in `public/images/responsive/`

## Performance Considerations

### Responsive Breakpoints Strategy
Images are served based on viewport width:
- Mobile (< 640px): 640w variant
- Tablet (640-1024px): 768w or 1024w variant
- Laptop (1024-1440px): 1024w or 1440w variant
- Desktop (1440-1920px): 1440w or 1920w variant
- Desktop HD (> 1920px): 1920w or 2460w variant

### Sizes Attribute
```html
sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 90vw"
```

Tells browser to use:
- 100% viewport width on mobile/tablet
- 90% viewport width on desktop (accounting for margins)

### Lazy Loading
All gallery images use `loading="eager"` since they're in the viewport on scroll.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Document project completion (this file)
2. ⏳ Review 4 missing artworks with content team
3. ⏳ Decide: process missing images or remove MDX files

### Optional
1. Add loading skeleton/placeholder for missing images
2. Implement progressive image loading with blur-up technique
3. Add image zoom/lightbox functionality (PhotoSwipe)
4. Monitor Cloudflare Analytics for image performance

### Future Improvements
1. Automated image processing pipeline for new artworks
2. WebP/AVIF format variants for better compression
3. Image CDN integration for global distribution
4. Automated image alt text generation from MDX metadata
