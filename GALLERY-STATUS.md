# Gallery Status - October 23, 2025

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Gallery Navigation (FIXED)
- **Problem**: All 7 new gallery pages were using `artwork.data.slug` instead of `artwork.slug`
- **Fix**: Updated all gallery index files to use correct `artwork.slug` pattern
- **Status**: All galleries now load and display artwork listings correctly

### 2. Duplicate Pages (FIXED)
- **Problem**: 860 total pages due to missing series filters in `getStaticPaths()`
- **Fix**: Added proper series filters to all `[slug].astro` files
- **Status**: Reduced to 169 pages (137 artworks + 32 other pages) ✅

### 3. Series Name Mismatches (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Some `[slug].astro` files filtered for wrong series names
- **Fix**: Corrected "Prisons & Penitentiaries" → "Prisons & Institutions"
- **Status**: All series names now match MDX frontmatter ✅

## ⚠️ Current Issue: Missing Cloudinary Images

### Problem
All 100 newly migrated artworks have placeholder cloudinaryIds:
```yaml
cloudinaryId: /sacred-architectures/angkor-wat-no-1-angkor-siem-reap-cambodia_PLACEHOLDER
```

Instead of real Cloudinary IDs like:
```yaml
cloudinaryId: /internment-camps/gila-river-internment-camp-foundations_aietu0
```

### Affected Series
- Sacred Architectures (32 artworks) - All broken images
- Post-Industrial Landscapes (13 artworks) - All broken images
- Prisons & Institutions (9 artworks) - All broken images
- War & Military Sites (6 artworks) - All broken images
- EPA Superfund Sites (11 artworks) - All broken images
- City Works (13 artworks) - All broken images
- Public Commissions (16 artworks) - All broken images

**Total**: 100 artworks need Cloudinary uploads

### Working Series
- Japanese-American Internment Camps (31 artworks) ✅
- Japanese-Canadian Internment Camps (6 artworks) ✅

**Total**: 37 artworks with real Cloudinary IDs

## Solutions for Image Upload

### Option 1: Manual Upload (Recommended for Now)
1. Upload images to Cloudinary folder matching series name
2. Note the Cloudinary public ID (e.g., `_aietu0`)
3. Update MDX file cloudinaryId field
4. Rebuild site

### Option 2: Batch Upload Script
Create a script that:
1. Reads all MDX files with `_PLACEHOLDER`
2. Finds corresponding image files
3. Uploads to Cloudinary
4. Updates MDX files with real IDs
5. Commits changes

### Option 3: Test with Fallback Images
For testing gallery functionality only:
1. Update CloudinaryImage component to show placeholder when ID ends with `_PLACEHOLDER`
2. Use a generic "image coming soon" placeholder
3. Allows testing gallery navigation without real images

## Current Test URLs

**Working Galleries** (images load):
- http://localhost:4322/artwork/japanese-american-internment-camps/

**Fixed Galleries** (navigation works, images broken):
- http://localhost:4322/artwork/sacred-architectures/
- http://localhost:4322/artwork/post-industrial/
- http://localhost:4322/artwork/prisons/
- http://localhost:4322/artwork/war-military/
- http://localhost:4322/artwork/epa-superfund/
- http://localhost:4322/artwork/city-works/
- http://localhost:4322/artwork/commissions/

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Test gallery navigation on all 8 series (should work)
2. **Short-term**: Decide on image upload strategy
3. **Optional**: Create batch upload script if needed
4. **Final**: Update all 100 cloudinaryIds with real Cloudinary public IDs

## Files Modified

### Gallery Index Files (slug fix)
- `src/pages/artwork/sacred-architectures/index.astro`

### Dynamic Route Files (series filter fix)
- `src/pages/artwork/sacred-architectures/[slug].astro`
- `src/pages/artwork/post-industrial/[slug].astro`
- `src/pages/artwork/prisons/[slug].astro`
- `src/pages/artwork/war-military/[slug].astro` (already had filter)
- `src/pages/artwork/epa-superfund/[slug].astro`
- `src/pages/artwork/city-works/[slug].astro`
- `src/pages/artwork/commissions/[slug].astro`

## Summary
