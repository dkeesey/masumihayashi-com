## Technical Details

### Migration Script
**Location**: `scripts/migrate-artworks.py`

**Features**:
- Reads from canonical markdown source (`/dk-sites/docs/masumi/canonical-content/artworks/`)
- Filters tier-1 artworks only
- Skips SHORT size variants (prevents duplicates)
- Transforms frontmatter fields (date‚Üíyear, medium‚Üímedia, dimensions‚Üísize with inch marks)
- Handles null/empty values properly (quotes empty strings)
- Escapes quotes in dimension strings
- Generates PLACEHOLDER Cloudinary IDs for now

**Target Counts**: Migrates up to navigation target for each series

### Frontmatter Format
```yaml
---
content-type: artwork
series: Sacred Architectures
slug: airavatesvara-temple-1-darasuram-tamil-nadu-india
name: Airavatesvara Temple #1, Darasuram, Tamil Nadu, India
title: Airavatesvara Temple #1, Darasuram, Tamil Nadu, India
altTag: Picture of Airavatesvara Temple #1... by Dr. Masumi Hayashi
media: Panoramic Photo Collage
year: 2004
city: Darasuram
state: Tamil Nadu
country: India
size: "53\" x 24\""
inventory: 1 framed
cloudinaryId: /sacred-architectures/airavatesvara-temple-1_PLACEHOLDER

```

### Build Output
```
14:26:26 [build] 69 page(s) built in 1.94s
14:26:26 [build] Complete!
```

**Warnings** (non-blocking):
- `No data-file specified` for artworks using PLACEHOLDER cloudinaryIds (expected)
- `Astro.glob is deprecated` (can upgrade later)
- `family-album collection empty` (not migrated in this session)

---

## Known Issues / Next Steps

### 1. Cloudinary Image IDs (CRITICAL BLOCKER)
**Status**: All artworks use `_PLACEHOLDER` suffix

**Issue**: Real Cloudinary image IDs needed for artworks to render images

**Options**:
1. **Audit Cloudinary** - Check existing folders, map real IDs
2. **Upload images** - Upload artwork images to Cloudinary with systematic naming
3. **Manual mapping** - Map piece IDs or slugs to existing Cloudinary assets

**Impact**: Artworks pages exist but show no images until real Cloudinary IDs added

### 2. Individual Artwork Detail Pages
**Status**: Only gallery pages exist, no individual artwork pages yet

**Needed**: Create `[slug].astro` dynamic route for each series (template exists for internment-camps)

**Estimate**: 1-2 hours to create 7 more dynamic routes

### 3. Navigation Missing "Browse All Artwork"
**Suggestion**: Add top-level "Browse All" link in mega menu

### 4. Missing Series
Not migrated (not in navigation target):
- Internee Portraits (8 artworks)
- Japanese-Canadian Internment Camps (separate 4 artworks - some already included in main internment series)
- Miscellaneous (3 artworks)

**Decision needed**: Should these be added as separate series or integrated?
