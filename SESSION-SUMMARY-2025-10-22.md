# Session Summary - October 22, 2025

## Complete Artwork Detail Page System

### What We Built

**Started with**: 69 pages (galleries only, broken detail page links)
**Ended with**: 254 pages (full detail page system across all 8 series)
**Added**: +185 functional artwork detail pages

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed All UX Issues ✅

#### Gallery Scroll Peek Effect
- **Before**: Next image barely visible (30vh, 30% opacity)
- **After**: 50vh height, 60% opacity, positioned at -25vh
- Creates enticing "half-rendered" effect

#### Icon Metaphor
- **Before**: Magnifying glass (zoom) - misleading
- **After**: Right arrow → (navigate) - correct metaphor

#### Keyboard Hints
- Added "Scroll, use Tab, or Space to view artwork"

#### RelatedArtworks Component
- **Before**: Broken, using GridLayout component
- **After**: Proper component integration with thumbnails
- Shows 3-6 related artworks from same series/camp
- Smart fallback: fills with other series if < 4 available
- Centered grids for 1-2 items

#### Duplicate Research Data
- **Before**: Research section appeared 2x
- **After**: Single rendering via layout

---

### 2. Created Detail Pages for All 7 Remaining Series ✅

**Using 7 Parallel Agents** (completed simultaneously in ~5 minutes):

1. Sacred Architectures
2. Post-Industrial Sites
3. Prisons & Penitentiaries
4. War & Military Sites
5. EPA Superfund Sites
6. City Works
7. Public Commissions

**New Infrastructure**:
- `ArtworkDetailLayout.astro` - Generic reusable layout
- 7x `[slug].astro` dynamic route files
- Each generates multiple pages per series at build time

**Every Detail Page Includes**:
- ✅ PhotoSwipe zoom (pinch/pan, 4x zoom, lightbox)
- ✅ Back to Gallery navigation
- ✅ Related Artworks section
- ✅ Clean thumbnails (no black boxes!)
- ✅ Responsive design

---

### 3. Fixed Granada Thumbnail Issues ✅

**Problem**: Missing leading `/` in cloudinaryId broke thumbnails
**Solution**:
- Fixed `granada-internment-camp-water-tank.mdx`
- Created `CLOUDINARY-ID-FORMAT.md` documentation
- Grep command to find future issues

---

### 4. Created Comprehensive Test Harness ✅

**Test Suite** (`tests/artwork-pages.spec.ts`):
- All 8 gallery pages load verification
- Detail page functionality (zoom, nav, related works)
- **WCAG 2 AA/AAA compliance** via axe-playwright
- PhotoSwipe zoom functionality
- Thumbnail rendering
- Navigation flow
- **6 browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari, Desktop Safari

**Test Results**:
- 198 tests passed ✅
- 107 tests failed (WCAG contrast violations + page load issues)
- 305 total tests
- Runs in parallel with 6 workers

## Build Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total Pages** | 69 | 254 | +185 (+268%) |
| **Series with Details** | 1 | 8 | +7 |
| **Build Time** | ~1.8s | ~2.0s | +0.2s |
| **Tests** | 0 | 305 | +305 |

## Known Issues (To Fix)

### WCAG 2 Compliance
- **107 test failures** related to color contrast
- Need to audit and fix contrast ratios
- Axe-playwright identifies specific violations

### Gallery Page Loading
- Some title regex matches failing
- May need to update page title format

---

## Key Learnings

### CloudinaryID Format Rule
**CRITICAL**: All cloudinaryId fields MUST start with `/`

```yaml
# ✅ Correct
cloudinaryId: /internment-camps/image_id

# ❌ Incorrect
cloudinaryId: internment-camps/image_id
```

Documented in `CLOUDINARY-ID-FORMAT.md` with grep command to find violations.

### Parallel Agent Strategy
- **7 agents in parallel** = ~5 minutes total
- Each agent created one `[slug].astro` file
- Massive time savings vs sequential approach
- All agents completed successfully

### Testing First Matters
- User caught missing tests before deployment
- Automated testing revealed WCAG issues
- Test harness now part of CI/CD workflow

---

## Deployment Status

**Cloudflare Pages**: Auto-deployed
**Preview**: https://masumihayashi-com.pages.dev/

**Test URLs**:
- Gallery: https://masumihayashi-com.pages.dev/artwork/sacred-architectures/
- Detail (with zoom): https://masumihayashi-com.pages.dev/artwork/japanese-american-internment-camps/gila-river-internment-camp-foundations/

---

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Fix WCAG 2 contrast violations** (107 failing tests)
2. **Fix gallery page title matches** (timeout issues)
3. **Run full test suite on deployed site**

### Medium Priority
1. Add more test coverage (edge cases)
2. Performance testing
3. SEO optimization

### Low Priority
1. Consider adding breadcrumb navigation
2. Add print stylesheets
3. Add share functionality

---

## Session Efficiency

**Parallelism Used**:
- ✅ 7 parallel agents for detail page creation
- ✅ 6 parallel browser workers for testing
- ✅ Concurrent builds and deployments

**Time Saved**:
- ~25-35 minutes (vs sequential agent approach)
- ~10-15 minutes (vs manual testing)
- **Total saved: ~40 minutes**
