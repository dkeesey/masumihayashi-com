Born in an American concentration camp.

Dr. Masumi Hayashi (1945-2006) was born in the Gila River War Relocation Center in Arizona, where 120,000 Japanese Americans were incarcerated during WWII.

Decades later, she returned to the camps as an artist - not with resentment, but with a camera and profound sense of purpose.

Her panoramic photo collages document these sites of historical trauma with both beauty and unflinching honesty. The landscapes are stunning. The history is dark. The tension between them is what makes her work unforgettable.

"These photographs are about beauty and irony, history and memory." - Masumi Hayashi

How do you photograph memory?

Dr. Masumi Hayashi pioneered a unique panoramic photo collage technique:

‚Üí Shoot from a single point
‚Üí Rotate 360 degrees
‚Üí Capture 20-30 individual exposures
‚Üí Hand-collage prints into seamless panoramas
‚Üí Create immersive, "reconstructed" spaces

The visible seams are intentional. They reference memory itself - fragmented, pieced together, imperfect but persistent.

The technique allows her to capture not just what a place looks like, but what it *feels* like to stand there, surrounded by history.

"These are landscapes of place representing the memory of that land." - Masumi Hayashi

Professor of Photography at Cleveland State University (1982-2006)
Work in permanent collections: LACMA, Japanese American National Museum, George Eastman House

### Caption
```
She was born in an internment camp in 1945.

In the 1990s, she returned.

Not as a victim. As an artist.

Dr. Masumi Hayashi documented the abandoned sites of Japanese American incarceration - the guard towers, the barracks foundations, the cemeteries, the monuments erected in defiance of forgetting.

Most Americans don't know these camps existed.
Many who do, don't know where they were.
Almost no one has seen what remains.

Hayashi's panoramic photographs preserve these landscapes before they disappear entirely. They are both beautiful and haunting - exactly as she intended.

"The collaged photographs create a visual tension between the physical beauty of these landscapes and their historical darkness." - Masumi Hayashi

A sansei (third-generation Japanese American) who transformed personal trauma into powerful art that ensures we never forget.

She's known for documenting Japanese American concentration camps.

But that's just the beginning.

Dr. Masumi Hayashi's panoramic photo collages explored landscapes of American trauma across four decades:

üì∑ Japanese-American Internment Camps (1990s)
‚Üí 10 camps where 120,000 were imprisoned

üì∑ EPA Superfund Sites (1980s-90s)
‚Üí America's most toxic landscapes

üì∑ American Prisons (1990s-2000s)
‚Üí Architecture of mass incarceration

üì∑ Sacred Architectures (1990s)
‚Üí Religious spaces across cultures

Each series examines place, memory, and the tension between beauty and darkness.

Her work asks: How do we remember what we'd rather forget? What remains when history tries to erase itself?

### Caption

Dr. Masumi Hayashi passed away in 2006.

Her photographs become more important every year.

Why?

1Ô∏è‚É£ The camps are disappearing
Many of the structures she documented 30 years ago are now gone. Her photographs are the last record.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Living survivors are aging
Fewer than 20,000 internment survivors remain alive today. Her work preserves their story.

3Ô∏è‚É£ History repeats itself
Family separation. Detention centers. Her work reminds us: we've done this before.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The work is timeless
Beyond documentation, these are museum-quality fine art photographs that stand on their own aesthetic power.

The Masumi Hayashi Foundation preserves and exhibits her complete body of work - ensuring future generations understand what happened and what she saw.

Born in an American concentration camp.
Became one of America's most important photographers.
Left us a visual record we cannot ignore.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Manual Posts (Test & Learn)
1. Create 6 biographical posts manually
2. Post over 2-3 weeks (2-3 posts per week)
3. Monitor engagement metrics
4. Identify which narratives resonate most

### Phase 2: Automation
1. Add "Share About Page" button to `/about` page
2. Add "Share Artist Statement" button to `/artist-statement` page
3. Pre-generate biographical image variants
4. Pre-write 3-5 caption variations per page
5. Let visitors share and tag Foundation

### Posting Schedule Suggestion
- **Monday AM**: Professional/educational content (Technique, Museums)
- **Wednesday PM**: Emotional/narrative content (Born in Camp, Return)
- **Friday PM**: Broader context (Beyond Camps, Legacy)
- **Weekend**: User-generated shares and engagement

### Success Metrics to Track
- Follower growth after biographical posts
- Website traffic from Instagram bio link
- Media inquiries or curator contacts
- Shares/saves (indicates people are keeping for reference)
- Comments from museum/gallery professionals

### Hashtag Strategy Notes
- 15-20 hashtags per post (Instagram sweet spot)
- Mix of broad (#Photography) and niche (#PanoramicPhotography)
- Include art world tags (#MuseumQuality, #CuratorialStudies)
- Use historical tags (#WWII, #JapaneseAmericanHistory)
- Tag relevant institutions when appropriate

## Next Steps

1. **Select strongest concept** - Which narrative resonates most with your vision?
2. **Source/create images** - Do we have photos of Masumi? Behind-the-scenes shots? Can we create graphic designs?
3. **Build share system** - Add Instagram share buttons to About/Artist Statement pages
4. **Create image variants** - Design Instagram-optimized images for each biographical post
5. **Schedule posts** - Plan cadence and timing for maximum curator/editor reach

**Key Question**: Do you have archival photos of Masumi working, teaching, or in exhibitions? Those would be powerful for Posts 2, 4, and 6.
