# Architecture Analysis & Content Strategy

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Active Development
**Purpose**: Identify architectural strengths, weaknesses, and critical blockers

---

## Executive Summary

The site has a solid technical foundation with good component architecture, schema.org implementation, and modern tooling. However, there's a **critical content gap**: navigation promises 8 artwork series but only 1 series has actual artwork data.

**Blocker**: Need to identify and implement data migration strategy for remaining 7 series (101 artworks) before gallery buildout can proceed.

## Architectural Weaknesses

### 1. Content Availability Gap ❌ **CRITICAL**

**Problem**: Navigation shows 8 series, but only 1 series has content

**Impact**:
- 7 broken gallery links (500+ clicks/month to 404 pages)
- Poor user experience
- SEO penalties for broken internal links
- Can't implement related artworks without content

**Current State**:
```
✅ Japanese American Internment Camps (37 artworks)
❌ Sacred Architectures (33 artworks) - NO DATA
❌ Post-Industrial Landscapes (13 artworks) - NO DATA
❌ Prisons & Institutions (9 artworks) - NO DATA
❌ War & Military Sites (6 artworks) - NO DATA
❌ EPA Superfund Sites (11 artworks) - NO DATA
❌ City Works (13 artworks) - NO DATA
❌ Public Commissions (16 artworks) - NO DATA
```

**Blocker**: Cannot proceed with gallery buildout without answering: **Where does the artwork data exist?**

Possible sources:
- Production WordPress site (masumihayashifoundation.org)?
- Cloudinary metadata extraction?
- Existing database/spreadsheet?
- Manual entry required?

**Recommendation**: Identify data source, create migration script/process

---

### 2. Schema Integration Not Systematic ⚠️

**Problem**: Schema markup is manually added to individual pages instead of being handled by layouts

**Current Approach** (manual):
```typescript
// about.astro
import { generatePersonSchema, generateBreadcrumbSchema } from '@lib/schema';
const schemas = [generatePersonSchema(), generateBreadcrumbSchema([...])];
<SchemaScript schema={schemas} slot="head" />
```

**Better Approach** (layout-driven):
```typescript
// BaseLayout.astro should automatically add:
- Organization schema (site-wide)
- Breadcrumb schema (based on URL)
// ArtworkLayout.astro should automatically add:
- Person schema (Masumi)
- VisualArtwork schema (from frontmatter)
- ImageObject schema (from Cloudinary ID)
```

**Impact**:
- Inconsistent schema application across pages
- Easy to forget schema on new pages
- More code duplication

**Recommendation**: Move schema generation into layouts with sensible defaults

---

### 3. Breadcrumbs Not Integrated ⚠️

**Problem**: Breadcrumbs component created but not integrated into layout system

**Current State**:
- ✅ `Breadcrumbs.astro` component exists
- ✅ `generateBreadcrumbSchema()` function exists
- ❌ Component not used in any layouts
- ❌ Requires manual prop passing to BaseLayout

**Impact**:
- No visual breadcrumbs on deep pages
- Missing SEO benefit from breadcrumb rich results
- Poor user wayfinding on artwork pages

**Recommendation**:
1. Integrate breadcrumbs into BaseLayout with auto-generation from URL
2. Add breadcrumbs to GalleryScrollLayout for artwork series
3. Use breadcrumb schema on all pages

---

### 4. Multiple Layout Types Without Clear Guidelines ⚠️

**Problem**: 5 different layout types but no documented usage patterns

**Available Layouts**:
1. `BaseLayout.astro` - Basic header/footer layout
2. `HeroLayout.astro` - Pages with hero images
3. `GalleryScrollLayout.astro` - Full-screen scrolling galleries
4. `LongFormLayout.astro` - Essays with table of contents
5. `ScrollSnapLayout.astro` - Snap-scrolling experiences

**Questions**:
- When should `BaseLayout` vs `HeroLayout` be used?
- Should artwork series use `GalleryScrollLayout` consistently?
- Can layouts be consolidated?

**Impact**:
- Inconsistent user experience across similar page types
- Harder for future developers to choose correct layout
- More code to maintain

**Recommendation**: Document layout decision tree in README

---

### 5. Content Collection Schema Duplication ⚠️

**Problem**: Two different schema definitions for artwork

**Location 1**: `src/content/config.ts`
```typescript
const artworkCollection = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    cloudinaryId: z.string(),
    series: z.string(),
    // ... 20+ fields
  })
});
```

**Location 2**: `src/content/artwork/internment-camps/config.ts`
```typescript
const artworksCollection = defineCollection({
  schema: z.object({
    cloudinaryId: z.string(),
    slug: z.string(),
    name: z.string(),
    // ... slightly different fields
  })
});
```

**Impact**:
- Confusing which schema is canonical
- Potential validation mismatches
- Harder to maintain consistency

**Recommendation**: Consolidate to single schema in `src/content/config.ts`

---

### 6. No Related Artworks Integration Yet ⚠️

**Problem**: `RelatedArtworks.astro` component created but not used anywhere

**Current State**:
- ✅ Component exists with proper styling
- ✅ Accepts array of artworks
- ❌ Not integrated into individual artwork pages
- ❌ No algorithm for selecting related works

**Impact**:
- Missing SEO opportunity (internal link building)
- Lower engagement (no cross-discovery)
- Unused code

**Recommendation**:
1. Add RelatedArtworks to individual artwork page template ([slug].astro)
2. Implement selection logic (same series, exclude current artwork)
3. Limit to 6 related works for performance

---

### 7. Missing Data Migration Documentation ❌ **CRITICAL**

**Problem**: No documented process for migrating artwork data from production site

**Questions**:
- How to extract artwork data from WordPress/current site?
- What's the mapping between old URLs and new structure?
- Are Cloudinary IDs consistent across environments?
- How to handle bulk content creation (138 artworks)?

**Impact**:
- Blocked on gallery buildout
- Risk of data loss or inconsistency
- Manual work without clear process

**Recommendation**: Create `CONTENT-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` documenting:
1. Data source identification
2. Extraction method (API, scraping, export)
3. Transformation/mapping logic
4. Import script for MDX file generation
5. Validation checklist

## Critical Path Forward

**Cannot proceed with gallery buildout until:**

1. ✅ Identify where the 101 missing artworks' data exists
2. ✅ Create migration/import process
3. ✅ Validate data integrity

**Questions for User:**

1. **Where is the artwork data for the remaining 7 series?**
   - Production WordPress site?
   - Spreadsheet/database?
   - Cloudinary metadata?

2. **What's the preferred migration approach?**
   - Automated script (API/scraping)?
   - Semi-automated (export → transform → import)?
   - Manual entry?

3. **Are Cloudinary IDs consistent?**
   - Same folder structure as production?
   - Need to re-upload images?

4. **URL structure mapping?**
   - How do old WordPress URLs map to new Astro routes?
   - Need 301 redirects?
